Extracts Malware Configurations using Malduck

This is a fork of the upstream work located here: https://github.com/c3rb3ru5d3d53c/mwcfg-modules. You
can use these modules in the same way using the CLI utility for MalDuck called [`mwcfg`](https://github.com/c3rb3ru5d3d53c/mwcfg) or using the Elastic tool called [`malware-exquacker`](https://github.com/elastic/malware-exquacker). Elastic Security researchers publish extractors for malware that we've
developed internally and make them available to the community as-is. Other modules from the upstream
repo have been modified to match our [Elastic Common Schema](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/)
output.

**Supported Modules:**
- ✔️ ASyncRAT
- ✔️ Azorult
- ✔️ Citadel
- ✔️ Cobalt Strike
- ✔️ Dridex
- ✔️ Hancitor
- ✔️ IcedID
  - ✔️ PhotoLoader
  - ✔️ PELoader
  - ✔️ Process Implant Memory
- ✔️ Phoreal
- ✔️ ZLoader
